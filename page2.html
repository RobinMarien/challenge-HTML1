    <div class="section">
        <p>Back when I was still a stagehand.. me and a colleague were early for the deconstruction of a stage at Pukkelpop.
        So.. we were told (by the production team) to wait out in the backstage area.
        The last DJs still had to start with their set, but they weren't there yet. We sat there for a little while and
        suddenly the Stage Manager entered the room. He started talking to us, seeming relieved we were "finally" there.
        Turns out, he thought we were the DJs.</p>

        <p>I could have performed at Pukkelpop, if I kept my mouth shut!</p>
